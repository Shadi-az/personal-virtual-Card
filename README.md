# My vCard Personal Portfolio 🧑‍💻💼

This repository is my `virtual card` that serves as my portfolio for the current time, with information about me, my skills, and my work. The `vCard` is responsive for all devices and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

It's a customised version based on the template created by [@CodeWithSadee](https://github.com/CodeWithSadee).
